# React PDF Table Example

I've seen people asking everywhere how the hell can you build a Table in react-pdf. The sad truth is that there is still no official component on the library that does it for you. However it doesn't mean that it's not possible, in fact it's not even hard, you just new to do a tiny bit of CSS styling.

In this repository I've built a simple example that shows how you can use \<View\>, \<Text\> and some ninja CSS to easily mimic the appearance of a table.
  
The example renders the table on the browser, and looks like this:


- Firefox 86.0 (Ubuntu)
- Chrome Version 89.0.4389.82 (Official Build) (64-bit)
